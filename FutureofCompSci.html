    <h1><br>The Future of Computer Science</h1>
    <h2>The most interesting thing about Computer Science is the impact it will have in the future, rather than the present.<br>
    Since the inception of the first computer, technology has advanced faster and faster than we could ever imagine, which is needless to say; what next?<br>

    <h3>Part 1: Virtual Reality</h3>
    <h2>We've all seen the Matrix, or any sci-fi movie with a terrifying future, where humanity lives the rest of their lives in a simulation or a game; but is this really going to happen?<br>
    Well, it might already be happening.<br>

    <h2>
    We're already at the point where we are able to devlop haptic feedback technology, which means that when interacting with an object with a virtual space, you will physically feel it on your body.
    We are in early stages of this technology. Virtual Reality headsets are still going to look like you've stuck a microwave to your face for some time; although the technology is there.
    Now how does this effect the future and our lives? Surely this will just effect the small amount of people who want VR gaming devices? I'm sure people said the same thing about smart phones, and now almost everyone in the world is using them.
