            <p>
              Proteins are the building blocks of life, each with a unique 3D
              structure. For the previous 50 years experimentally figuring out
              the specific structure of proteins has often taken many years and
              significant amounts of money. There are over 200 million proteins
              known to science, the structure and function of which may provide
              insights into life and aid in development of medicines. However,
              until recently, it was only possible to study the structures of a
              tiny fraction of these proteins.

            <p>
              Using technology developed when AlphaGo beat
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Sedol">Lee Sedol</a> in
              2016, DeepMind began development of a machine learning model to
              predict the 3D structure of proteins. Trained on the structures
              and sequences of over 100,000 known proteins, the model learned to
              predict structures with surprising accuracy, beating humans by a
              significant margin.
